Data-Driven hadoop-based programming framework.
==================================================

Intro
--------------------------------------
This framework based on two main concepts: 
1. KeyValueDataSet - represents the sequence file on hdfs, controls its data and provide usefull method to manipulate it
2. Operation - operation which transform on KeyValueDataSet to another (Map-, Reduce-, or MapReduce- Job).

The main goal of this framework is to abstract from the hadop routines like: Jobs, Writables, Configuration, IO, etc.
